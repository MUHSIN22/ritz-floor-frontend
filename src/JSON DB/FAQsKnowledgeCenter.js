        question: "What is Laminate Flooring?",
        answer: "Laminate floors are inexpensive alternative to hardwood floors. Laminate is actually made up of residual wood fibres that are mixed with resins and binders and then formed into high density fibreboard (HDF) panels. The panels are milled to form a click together locking system to allow for easy installation. A decorative wood grain paper is attached to the panel and then a top surface wear layer containing aluminum oxide to help resist wearing fading and staining. A backing layer is added to the bottom of the panel for stability and moisture resistance. These layers are laminated together under extreme pressure and then cut into the planks or tiles.",

        question: "Why should I choose vinyl flooring?",
        answer: "Vinyl floors provide consumers with a soft and comfortable flooring option that is well suited for areas where moisture might be an issue. Today, vinyl floors come in a wide variety of sizes, styles, designs and colours to satisfy even the most discerning shopper. It is often referred to as “resilient” flooring and is mold, mildew and moisture resistant, making it a popular choice for kitchens, bathrooms, laundry rooms and any other area where occasional spills or moisture might be a concern. Vinyl is also easy to clean and maintain.",
    },
    {
        question: "How are vinyl floors made?",
        answer: "Generally speaking, vinyl is made up of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), plasticizers, resins and stabilizers and offers unlimited design options. It is available in a sheet vinyl which comes in rolls up to 13’ wide and can be installed in one continuous piece and can also be seamed together for larger areas. It is also available as a luxury vinyl tile (LVT) and as a luxury vinyl plank (LVP) for customers who prefer to install their new floor as modular pieces.",

    {
        question: "How do you install vinyl flooring?",
        answer: "There are three basic ways to install vinyl flooring including loose lay, perimeter glue and fully glued. The loose lay installation method should be limited to smaller areas (less than 100 sq ft) that are not considered high traffic areas and a perimeter glued installation might be more appropriate for medium size areas (up to 200 sq ft) or areas that have more foot traffic such as foyers. For larger size installations (over 200 sq ft) and areas that are considered high traffic a fully glued installation is recommended. For fully glued installations you can choose between permanent or releasable adhesives which offer the ability to reposition or remove the flooring with relative ease.",

        question: "What are the ways for Vinyl floor care and maintenance?",
        answer: "Vinyl floors offer easy care and maintenance to consumers providing they abide by a few precautions. For general care and cleaning of your vinyl floor, sweep your floor regularly and be sure to wipe up spills promptly. Occasional mopping with a cleaning solution that is approved by the manufacturer will help to remove any dried on spills, smudges and smears. Do not use soap or detergent products for vinyl floors as they will leave a dulling film on the surface. Vinyl floors offer excellent stain resistance and most spills will wipe up quickly and easily with a clean cloth. Some types of spills will require more attention. Use a clean white cloth and turn the cloth often to avoid spreading the stain. Vinyl floors might fade or discolour due to extreme heat or direct sunlight so it is important to protect your floors by closing your curtains or blinds whenever possible. It is also important to protect exterior entryways with doormats but do not use rubber-backed, latex-backed, or coco fibre mats on your floor because they may stain or damage the surface.",

        question: "What are the ways for Laminate floor care and maintenance?",
        answer: "Laminate floors are remarkably durable and easy to care for, but like any other flooring product certain limitations apply in regards to cleaning. Regular sweeping or vacuuming to remove dirt and grit will help eliminate potential scratching of your laminate floors. For footprints, smudges and smears it is recommended to clean the area with an approved laminate cleaner and microfibre mop. By spraying the cleaner on to the mop, not the floor, you can control the amount of moisture applied to the floor. Do not use soap or detergent-based cleaners, wax-based products, or any type of polish as they leave a dull, filmy residue. Do not flood your floor with water. Excessive moisture applied to a laminate floor can result in blistering of the top layer so any type of damp mopping should be avoided and used sparingly. Be sure to wipe up accidental spills and excess moisture with a paper towel. To eliminate bridging and gapping of your laminate floors maintain a constant humidity range between 40% – 60%.",

        question: "What are the ways for Wood floor care and maintenance",
        answer: "Proper care of your new hardwood and engineered floors is very similar to the care and maintenance required for laminate floors. Regular sweeping or vacuuming to remove dirt and grit will help eliminate potential scratching of your wood floors. Surface footprints, smudges and smears can be cleaned with an approved hardwood cleaner and microfiber mop. By spraying the cleaner on to the mop, not the floor, you can control the amount of moisture applied to the floor. Do not use soap or detergent-based cleaners, wax-based products, or any type of polish as they leave a dull, filmy residue. Do not flood your floor with water. Excessive moisture applied to a wood floor can permanently dull the finish so damp mopping should be avoided completely. Be sure to wipe up accidental spills and excess moisture with a paper towel. Wood floors react to seasonal changes in humidity in your home and to help minimize cupping, bridging and gapping of your hardwood floors it is important to maintain a constant humidity range between 40% – 60%.",

        question: "What is engineered hardwood flooring?",
        answer: "Engineered hardwood flooring is a product made up of a core of plywood or high density fibreboard (HDF) and a top layer of a hardwood veneer that is glued to the top surface of the core. The top veneer can range in thickness between 0.5 mm – 5mm (and more) and can be made from a wide variety of wood species.",
    },
    {
        question: "What is the difference between engineered flooring and laminate flooring?",
        answer: "The core of laminate is typically made of HDF and the top layer is a photograph of a wood species mounted on top of the core. The core of an engineered floor can be plywood or HDF and the top layer is an actual layer (veneer) of a hardwood species. This is a key difference between the two flooring types.",
    },
    {
        question: "What is the difference between engineered flooring and solid hardwood flooring?",
        answer: "Solid hardwood is exactly what the name implies, a solid piece of wood, normally ¾” thick and available in various widths and lengths. An engineered floor is a thin layer of hardwood (veneer layer) mounted on a core made up of HDF or plywood.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do you lose the natural beauty of the wood when buying an engineered floor?",
        answer: "Not at all – the top hardwood layer is the same genuine hardwood you have with a solid hardwood floor, just thinner. The top veneer is available in most species of hardwood and typically has the same type of finish applied.",
    },
    {
        question: "Why should I purchase engineered flooring instead of solid hardwood?",
        answer: "Engineered floors are much more structurally stable than solid hardwood floors because the core of the product is made up of pressed woods (plywood or HDF) which have fewer natural voids than a solid piece of hardwood. Engineered floors also offer more flexible installation choices including nailed down, glued together and even clicked together. Engineered floors can be installed on grade, above grade and even below grade where most hardwoods are more limited in the installation application.",
